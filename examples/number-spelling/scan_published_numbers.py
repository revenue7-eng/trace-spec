"""Find integer-typed members written with a fraction or an exponent (agentrust-io/trace-spec#247).

Deciding integers by value changes a verdict only where an integer-typed member is
written with a fraction or an exponent, such as `1785000000.0` or `1.785e9` for
`1785000000`. This script counts the published documents that carry one. Every
verdict the proposal changes is on such a document, so a count of zero means that no
published verdict changes.

    python examples/number-spelling/scan_published_numbers.py [ROOT ...]

Each ROOT is a directory, searched for `*.json` files and for fenced blocks labelled
`json` in `*.md` files; the default is this repository's `examples/`. One that does
not parse, such as an elided example, is counted and skipped; `jsonc` blocks are not
read. This directory is skipped when it sits inside a ROOT, because its vectors are
re-spelled on purpose; name it as a ROOT to scan it, which is a check that the scan
finds what it is looking for. Exit status 1 means an integer-typed member was found
written with a fraction or an exponent.

A member is integer-typed when a schema in `schema/` types it `integer`, matched on
the member's name and its parent's; when it sits in `cnf.jwk`, whose undeclared
members the schema holds to integers; or when a profile types it in prose, as
`observed_at` (docs/integration/pic-trace-bridge-v1.md) and `tool_catalog.tool_count`
(spec/server-provenance-v1.md) are. Python's `json` module keeps the spelling of
every number in reach through its `parse_int` and `parse_float` hooks, which is how
the spelling is read here; a parser that returns only values cannot see it.
Standard library only.
