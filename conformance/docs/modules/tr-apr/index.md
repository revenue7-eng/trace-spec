# TR-APR: Appraisal

An appraisal is a verifier's verdict on the hardware evidence behind a record. This module checks that the verdict the record carries is well formed and, from Level 1, positive. It reads the verdict as written and fetches nothing.

Tests the evidence appraisal the record carries: the verifier's verdict, who issued it, which policy it was issued under, and when.

| TR-APR-001 | `appraisal.status` is one of the four values `schemas/trace-claim.json` enumerates           | `affirming`, `warning`, `contraindicated`, `none`                       | `"verified"`, `"AFFIRMING"`, `7`, absent; also an absent or non-object `appraisal`             |
| TR-APR-002 | `appraisal.verifier` is an absolute URI                                                      | `https://verifier.example.org`                                          | `nvidia-openshell/0.3.0` (no scheme), a URI carrying whitespace or a control character, absent |
| TR-APR-003 | `appraisal.policy_ref`, when present, is an absolute URI                                     | `https://policies.example.org/appraisal/v3`; absent (optional, skipped) | `./policies/v1`, `ht tp://x`                                                                   |
| TR-APR-004 | `appraisal.timestamp`, when present, is an integer of epoch seconds and is not in the future | a past epoch second; absent (optional, skipped)                         | `"1748000042"` (string), a float, a boolean, an epoch second in the future                     |

## Required at Level 1+

| Test ID    | Description                       | Positive Case | Negative Case                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| TR-APR-005 | `appraisal.status` is `affirming` | `affirming`   | `none`, `warning`, `contraindicated` |

At Level 0 this check is skipped rather than passed. `docs/levels.md`'s own minimum conformant Level 0 record carries `"status": "none"`, so a Level 0 record is not asked to affirm.

## Absent optional fields skip, and a skip is not a pass

`policy_ref` and `timestamp` are optional. When either is absent TR-APR reports a skip, which says the check was not performed. Reporting a pass would say the field was examined and found sound, and nothing was examined.

## What TR-APR does not do

**It never resolves anything.** TR-APR performs no network access and no filesystem access, and it takes no resolver. TR-APR-003 checks the *shape of the name* of the appraisal policy; it does not fetch that policy and does not compare it against anything.

Resolving a cited object against a declared digest is TR-POL-003's work, on a different field: `policy.policy_uri` resolved against `policy.bundle_hash`. The record carries a digest for the enforced policy bundle and no digest for the appraisal policy, so there is nothing here for a second verifier to compare a retrieved bundle against. Two fields, two objects, no overlapping assertion.

Because nothing here has a referent to lose, no TR-APR code can report `UNVERIFIED`, and none appears in the unverified-level table in `docs/levels.md`. Every check either passes, fails, or skips.

`appraisal.provenance_depth_verified` is not checked. The schema admits it and no published sentence states what a verifier must do with it, so enforcing anything about it would be this suite inventing a requirement rather than testing one.
