# TR-RTE: Runtime

This module looks at what the record says about the hardware the agent ran on: which kind of TEE (trusted execution environment, a processor mode that keeps a program's memory sealed off) and the measurement (a fingerprint of the code loaded into it). It checks that those claims are well formed. It does not prove them; that takes checking the hardware's own signed report, which happens outside this suite.

Checks runtime claim fields and, at Level 1 or above, the verifier's nonce. This module does not fetch reference manifests, verify hardware quotes, authenticate platform certificates, or compare measurements against an approved image.

## Checks

| Test ID    | Actual check                                                                                 | Boundary                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TR-RTE-001 | Platform belongs to the registered set; `software-only` is rejected above Level 0            | A registered platform string is not hardware evidence                               |
| TR-RTE-002 | Measurement has `sha256:` plus 64 lowercase hex digits or `sha384:` plus 96                  | Format only; all-zero values also match this check                                  |
| TR-RTE-003 | If present, `rim_uri` is a string starting with `https://`; absent means skipped             | No network request, HTTP status check, URI resolution, or reference-image appraisal |
| TR-RTE-004 | At Level 1 or above, a nonempty runtime nonce matches the verifier's nonempty expected nonce | Compares claim values; does not establish binding to a hardware quote               |

The registered set includes `intel-tdx`, `amd-sev-snp`, `azure-cvm-sev-snp`, `nvidia-h100`, `nvidia-blackwell`, `aws-nitro`, `arm-cca`, `google-confidential-space`, `tpm2`, and `software-only`.

Use independently trusted hardware evidence, expected measurements, key binding, and provider-specific appraisal outside these format checks.
