# Writing Custom TRACE Conformance Tests

This guide is for developers who produce TRACE records and want their own automated tests for them. It shows how to call the suite's checks from pytest (a common Python test runner) and test one field of a record at a time, using the `trace_tests` library.

## What you'll learn

- What the three conformance levels require and which modules activate at each level
- How to build a minimal TRACE record fixture and call the module `check()` functions directly
- How to interpret `Finding` results and match them to error codes

## Prerequisites

```
pip install agentrust-trace-tests pytest cryptography
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Understand the conformance levels

TRACE defines three levels. Each level activates a cumulative set of modules:

| Level | Required modules               | Typical use                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | TR-ENV, TR-SIG, TR-POL, TR-APR | Development and staging, no secure hardware         |
| 1     | Level 0 + TR-RTE, TR-SCA       | Records that declare a TEE platform and measurement |
| 2     | Level 1 + TR-TXN, TR-ANC       | Full records with SCITT transparency anchoring      |

At Level 0 you can set `runtime.platform` to `"software-only"` and skip hardware attestation entirely. At Level 1 you must supply a TEE measurement (a fingerprint of the code loaded into a trusted execution environment) from AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, NVIDIA H100, or similar. Level 2 adds a SCITT receipt URI and a bound tool-call transcript hash.

The `runner.run()` function respects this table. Modules not required at the requested level are never invoked.

______________________________________________________________________

## Run the existing test suite

The published suite uses pytest markers to group tests by level:

```
# Run everything
pytest

# Run only Level 0 tests
pytest -m level0

# Short traceback, stop after the first failure
pytest --tb=short -x
```

Each test file uses a pytest fixture (defined in `tests/conftest.py`) that loads a JSON vector or builds a signed record in memory. The fixture names match the level they cover: `valid_level0`, `signed_eat_fixture`, `trust_record`.

A passing run looks like:

```
tests/test_level0.py::TestLevel0Conformance::test_schema_valid PASSED
tests/test_level0.py::TestLevel0Conformance::test_eat_profile_sentinel PASSED
...
```

A skip appears when a test is conditional on an optional field:

```
tests/test_level0.py::TestLevel0Conformance::test_transcript_digest_when_present SKIPPED
```

A failure looks like:

```
FAILED tests/test_level1.py::test_tee_platform_present
AssertionError: TR-RTE-001: runtime.platform must be a recognised TEE enum value
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Understand the module system

Each module is a Python file under `src/trace_tests/modules/`. Every module exposes a `check()` function that accepts the extracted TRACE fields dict and returns `list[Finding]`.

```
# Every module follows this pattern
from trace_tests.modules import tr_pol
from trace_tests.result import Finding, Status

findings: list[Finding] = tr_pol.check(trace_dict)
```

A `Finding` carries three fields:

```
finding.code     # e.g. "TR-POL-001"
finding.status   # Status.PASS, Status.FAIL, Status.SKIP, or Status.UNVERIFIED
finding.message  # human-readable detail

finding.passed()      # True when status == PASS
finding.failed()      # True when status == FAIL
finding.skipped()     # True when status == SKIP
finding.unverified()  # True when status == UNVERIFIED
```

`UNVERIFIED` is distinct from `SKIP`. It means the check could not reach the evidence it needed: for TR-SIG-005, a signature that can be verified; for TR-POL-003, a policy bundle that could be read. Each code has a level from which it counts as a failure (TR-SIG-005 from Level 1, TR-POL-003 from Level 2; see [Unverified findings](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/conformance/docs/levels/#unverified-findings)), so a caller cannot mistake an unverified record for a passing one.

______________________________________________________________________

## Write a custom test

The simplest pattern is to build a minimal trace dict, call the module directly, and assert on the findings.

```
# tests/custom/test_my_policy.py
import pytest
from trace_tests.modules import tr_pol
from trace_tests.result import Status


def _policy_trace(bundle_hash: str, enforcement_mode: str) -> dict:
    return {
        "policy": {
            "bundle_hash": bundle_hash,
            "enforcement_mode": enforcement_mode,
        }
    }


def test_sha256_bundle_hash_passes():
    trace = _policy_trace(
        bundle_hash="sha256:" + "a" * 64,
        enforcement_mode="enforce",
    )
    findings = tr_pol.check(trace)
    assert all(not f.failed() for f in findings), findings


def test_md5_bundle_hash_fails_tr_pol_001():
    trace = _policy_trace(bundle_hash="md5:abc123", enforcement_mode="enforce")
    codes = {f.code for f in tr_pol.check(trace) if f.failed()}
    assert "TR-POL-001" in codes


def test_unknown_enforcement_mode_fails_tr_pol_002():
    trace = _policy_trace(
        bundle_hash="sha256:" + "b" * 64,
        enforcement_mode="strict",  # not in {enforce, advisory, silent, declared}
    )
    codes = {f.code for f in tr_pol.check(trace) if f.failed()}
    assert "TR-POL-002" in codes
```

For modules that need the full raw record (TR-SIG), pass both the extracted trace and the raw record:

```
from trace_tests.modules.tr_sig import check as check_sig

# fmt is "cmcp-runtime" for cMCP envelopes, "trace" for plain TRACE records
findings = check_sig(trace=record["trace"], record=record, fmt="cmcp-runtime", level=0)
```

For TR-ENV, pass `max_age_seconds` to override the default 24-hour freshness window in tests:

```
from trace_tests.modules.tr_env import check as check_env

findings = check_env(trace, max_age_seconds=3600)
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Build a signed fixture

When you need a cryptographically valid record (required for TR-SIG tests at Level 1+), generate a key pair and sign the canonical JSON body yourself:

```
import base64
import json
import time

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519 import Ed25519PrivateKey


def _b64url(b: bytes) -> str:
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(b).rstrip(b"=").decode()


def _canonical_json(d: dict) -> bytes:
    return json.dumps(d, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=True).encode()


def build_signed_cmcp_record(platform: str = "tpm2") -> dict:
    priv = Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()
    pub_raw = priv.public_key().public_bytes_raw()
    x = _b64url(pub_raw)
    kid = f"test-{pub_raw[:4].hex()}"

    record = {
        "cmcp_version": "1.0",
        "trace": {
            "eat_profile": "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2",
            "iat": int(time.time()) - 30,
            "subject": "spiffe://cmcp.gateway/session/my-test",
            "runtime": {
                "platform": platform,
                "measurement": "sha256:" + "a" * 64,
            },
            "policy": {
                "bundle_hash": "sha256:" + "b" * 64,
                "enforcement_mode": "enforce",
            },
            "data_class": "internal",
            "cnf": {"jwk": {"kty": "OKP", "crv": "Ed25519", "x": x, "kid": kid}},
        },
        "gateway": {"session_id": "my-test"},
        "signature": "",
    }

    body = _canonical_json({k: v for k, v in record.items() if k != "signature"})
    record["signature"] = _b64url(priv.sign(body))
    return record
```

This matches the helper pattern in `tests/conftest.py` and the `_build_signed_cmcp_record` function used by the published fixtures.

______________________________________________________________________

## Interpret error codes

Error codes follow the pattern `TR-<MODULE>-<NNN>`. The module prefix tells you which spec section failed; the number points to the specific field. The full table is at [Error Codes](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/conformance/docs/error-codes/index.md).

Common codes you will encounter:

| Code       | Field                     | Fix                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| TR-ENV-001 | `eat_profile`             | Must be `tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2`         |
| TR-ENV-002 | `iat`                     | Must be a Unix timestamp in the last 24 hours          |
| TR-SIG-005 | `signature`               | Signature missing, unverifiable, or does not verify    |
| TR-SIG-004 | `cnf.jwk`                 | Supported key type, and no private key material        |
| TR-POL-001 | `policy.bundle_hash`      | Must match `sha256:<64 hex chars>`                     |
| TR-POL-002 | `policy.enforcement_mode` | Must be `enforce`, `advisory`, `silent`, or `declared` |
| TR-RTE-001 | `runtime.platform`        | Must be a registered TEE platform enum                 |

When a finding carries `status == Status.UNVERIFIED`, the check could not reach its evidence, for example because the record has no signature. It is never a benign skip, and from the level its code names it fails the run.

______________________________________________________________________

## Summary

You ran the existing suite with pytest, called individual module `check()` functions directly, and built a signed test fixture from scratch. The `Finding` dataclass with `code`, `status`, and `message` fields is the single interface across all eight modules.

Next steps: [CI Integration](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/conformance/docs/tutorials/ci-integration/index.md) shows how to run these tests in GitHub Actions with matrix Python versions and artifact upload.
