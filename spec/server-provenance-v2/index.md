**In plain terms.** Version 2 of the MCP server provenance format adds four of a tool's self-declared behaviours (for example, whether it only reads data) to what gets signed, so a later change to them is detectable. It is for people who publish or check MCP server provenance records, and it is a draft proposal.

## 1. Scope and inherited requirements

This version binds four behavioral declarations in an MCP tool catalog. All requirements of [Server Provenance v1](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/spec/server-provenance-v1/index.md) apply except the format identifier and catalog projection specified below. In particular, identity, assurance kinds, trusted-key selection, signatures, anchoring and absence retain their v1 meanings. This is a separate provenance format version, not a new TRACE Trust Record version.

The record's `format` MUST be `agentrust-io/mcp-server-provenance/2`. It is covered by the signature. A verifier MUST reject unknown versions and MUST select the catalog projection from the signed format. It MUST NOT retry a mismatching v2 catalog using the v1 projection.

## 2. Catalog projection

For each tool, v2 adds an `annotations` object to the v1 projection of `name`, `description` and `input_schema`. The object MUST contain exactly these four boolean members, using the following defaults for absent members:

| Member            | Default |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| `readOnlyHint`    | `false` |
| `destructiveHint` | `true`  |
| `idempotentHint`  | `false` |
| `openWorldHint`   | `true`  |

These defaults follow MCP's [ToolAnnotations definition](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts). An absent `annotations` member is equivalent to an empty object. A present `annotations` value MUST be an object; explicit null is invalid. Each present behavioral member MUST be a JSON boolean. Null, numbers and strings MUST NOT be coerced to booleans or treated as absent.

```
{"name":"write","description":"Write a file","input_schema":{"type":"object"},"annotations":{"readOnlyHint":false,"destructiveHint":true,"idempotentHint":false,"openWorldHint":true}}
```

The list is sorted and hashed with the same sorted-key canonicalization and SHA-256 rules as v1 section 4. `inputSchema` is accepted as the wire spelling of `input_schema`; if both appear, their canonical values MUST agree. Missing `name`, `description` or input schema retain v1's null projection. This projection does not replace MCP tool validation.

All four declarations are retained even when `readOnlyHint` is true. MCP gives destructive and idempotent hints behavioral meaning only for non-read-only tools; v2 nevertheless binds the declarations themselves, including otherwise inactive ones. Omitted and explicitly defaulted values have identical hashes. Any boolean change has a different projection. Output schemas, annotation titles, other annotations, `_meta` and vendor extensions remain excluded.

## 3. Verification and migration

A verifier supporting both versions MUST preserve v1's original projection. Existing v1 signatures and catalog hashes do not acquire annotation coverage. Consumers requiring behavioral annotation binding MUST require v2 explicitly; accepting any supported version is insufficient. Signature verification and live catalog comparison remain separate required checks.

The reference library retains `FORMAT`, `build_record()` and `tool_catalog_hash()` defaults as v1. New producers select `format=FORMAT_V2` in both APIs. Consumers can enforce v2 with `required_format=FORMAT_V2` in both `verify_record()` and `check_tool_catalog()`. Old v1-only verifiers reject v2; upgrade consumers before switching producers. Do not relabel an existing record: recompute its catalog hash and sign a new record. An empty catalog has the same digest in both versions; the signed format still distinguishes their contracts.

## 4. Limits and conformance

A bound hint is an authenticated declaration, not evidence of actual behavior. Consumers MUST NOT infer behavioral guarantees or permission to execute from a successful catalog comparison. Trusted-key selection and local authorization remain necessary. MCP cautions against trusting hints from untrusted servers.

In addition to v1's inherited checks, v2 conformance requires accepting omitted and explicitly defaulted hints equivalently, detecting each behavioral hint change, rejecting malformed hint values, preserving v1 verification, rejecting unknown formats, and rejecting v1 when v2 is required. The reference tests in `tests/test_provenance_v2.py` exercise these boundaries, including all 16 boolean combinations and changes to each member.
