# Schema Reference

This page lists every field a TRACE v0.2 Trust Record can contain, its type, and whether it is required. A Trust Record is the signed receipt TRACE produces for one AI agent run. Use this page when you write code that produces or reads records; if you only want to see one working, start with the [quickstart](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/quickstart/index.md).

The machine-readable version is a JSON Schema (a file that software uses to check a record has the right shape): [`schema/trace-claim.json`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec/blob/main/schema/trace-claim.json).

In short: whole numbers in a record have a size limit, and anything larger is written as a string. The detail is below.

Technical detail: the integer range and what counts as an integer

Every field typed `integer` here is bounded to -9007199254740991 through 9007199254740991, and no field is typed `number`. That is not a size limit on the data; it is what spec section 3.2.2 can canonicalize unambiguously, since RFC 8785 serializes numbers through an IEEE 754 double and two integers outside that range can share one. A value that needs to be larger is carried as a string. The same bound applies to members a `cnf.jwk` carries that this schema does not name.

Whether a number is an integer is decided by its value, not by how it is written (spec section 3.2.2, "What counts as an integer"). `1785000000.0` and `1.785e9` are the integer 1785000000; `1785000000.5` is not an integer. JSON Schema defines `integer` the same way, so validating against this schema already gives that answer.

## `model`

Which AI model the run used. These fields tie the record to one exact model artifact (the model file and version).

## `policy`

Which rule set (the governance policy) was in force during the run, pinned by its hash.

| Field              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `enforcement_mode` | string | **yes**  | One of: `enforce` (evaluated, blocked on deny), `advisory` (evaluated, logged, allowed), `silent` (evaluated and allowed, including on deny, with operational logs suppressed; the audit chain still records every would-have-denied decision), `declared` (the policy is named and bound into the signed record and nothing evaluated it: the honest value for a producer with no policy engine, never a default, and not evidence that any rule was checked). Defaults to `enforce`. Section 4.3 of the spec defines `enforce`, `silent` and `declared`; `advisory` is in the schema's closed set and its one-line meaning is the schema's own description, not spec text |

## `data_class`

String. Sensitivity classification applied to the data processed in this session.

Defined values: `public`, `internal`, `confidential`, `restricted`, `secret`.

Custom values are allowed and should follow your organization's data classification policy.

## `tool_transcript`

A summary of the tool calls the agent made during the run, with a hash that commits to the full list.

| Field            | Type    | Required | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hash`           | string  | **yes**  | `sha256:` of the canonical JSON of the full `AuditEntry` list |
| `call_count`     | integer | **yes**  | Number of tool invocations recorded                           |
| `transcript_uri` | string  | no       | URI to the full per-call transcript (may be encrypted)        |

## `delegation`

Used when another agent handed this agent the authority to act (delegation, defined by the A2A profile). Present when this execution acted on authority delegated by another agent; absent on a root (non-delegated) execution. A chain of records linked this way forms an offline-verifiable delegation DAG: a verifier walks `parent_record_hash` from a leaf record back to the root and confirms each hop acted under a credential in the delegation chain.

| Field                | Type   | Required | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `parent_record_hash` | string | **yes**  | `sha256:`/`sha384:` digest of the parent hop's Trust Record  |
| `credential_id`      | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the delegation credential this hop acted under |

## `origin`

Says who assembled the record. Absent means the runtime produced its own record, which is what every hardware profile is and what a consumer assumes. Present means something else assembled the record from evidence it did not itself measure.

It exists because `runtime.platform: "software-only"` is ambiguous on its own: it is the honest value for a dev-mode record, where nothing attested the execution, and for a record transcribed from another vendor's control plane, where the party asserting the evidence also wrote the log.

| Field             | Type    | Required | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`            | string  | **yes**  | `self`, `third-party-control-plane`, or `log-import`                      |
| `producer`        | string  | **yes**  | Identifier of the system that produced the source evidence                |
| `source_event_id` | string  | no       | Identifier of the source event in that system                             |
| `ingested_at`     | integer | no       | Unix time the evidence was ingested; `iat` is when this record was issued |

A record whose `kind` is not `self` **must** carry `runtime.platform: "software-only"`. An importer holding someone else's log has no quote to present, so a hardware platform on such a record is untrue rather than stronger. Both the reference model and `schema/trace-claim.json` reject the combination.

## `references`

An array of pointers to facts held outside this record: an authorization decided before execution, a human approval, a behavioural trace, an independent check's finding, an observed change of state. What the signature attests is that this record points there, not the truth of what it points at.

`origin` records where evidence *came from* and can lower assurance. `references` records what a record *points at* and cannot. Before the block existed, a record that needed to name something external had to use `origin` and take `runtime.platform: "software-only"` with it, which said something untrue about how the evidence was obtained.

| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rel`       | string | **yes**  | Registered values: `authorized-intent`, `approval-outcome`, `behavior-trace`, `condition-appraisal`, `observed-effect`. A registry rather than a closed set, so the schema does not restrict which relation is named: only that one is: the value must be non-empty |
| `id`        | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the referenced fact within the resolver's system                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `resolver`  | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the party obliged to resolve `id`                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `retention` | string | no       | ISO 8601 duration the resolver undertakes to keep `id` resolvable. An undertaking only; nothing enforces it                                                                                                                                                         |
| `digest`    | string | no       | `sha256:` or `sha384:` digest of the referenced object, when the producer holds it at issue time                                                                                                                                                                    |

`rel` is open where `origin.kind` is closed. Section 3.1.1 says `kind` is a closed set "because the value of the field is that a verifier can key on it"; section 3.1.2 calls `rel`'s values a registry and does not say that, so a new relation is a spec change and not also a schema change. What each registered value's referenced object is, what a verifier may conclude from it, and how a name is added are in [`references-registry.md`](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/references-registry/index.md).

Spec section 3.1.2 also binds verifiers: one **must not** reject a record because an entry cannot be resolved, and **must not** treat a resolved entry as attested evidence. A reference that could invalidate a record would hand whoever controls the target a way to invalidate evidence they do not hold. Both are verifier behaviour, so neither the schema nor the reference model can enforce them; they are conformance-suite rules. What the schema and the model do enforce is the shape, and that a producer who cannot name a `resolver` cannot emit an empty one.

## `reproducibility`

In plain terms: a claim that someone can re-run the part of the run that decided what happened, and get the same transcript. The precise boundary follows.

The claim that re-executing a named deterministic function of the run, over a pinned input closure, yields a transcript whose RFC 8785 canonical digest equals `transcript_digest`. Spec section 3.1.4. The function is the producer's coordination logic: the code that decided what ran, in what order, on what inputs. It is not the workload's side effects, which are not re-executed, and not the model calls, which are not deterministic; the boundary is drawn around every non-deterministic interaction, and each one enters the closure as a recorded, content-addressed input.

The block is the claim, not its result. The result is an appraisal attributed to the party that re-ran the function (in a record signed only by its producer, the producer's report of that party's result, not authenticated by it), carried under [`appraisal.method`](#trace-field-appraisal) and `appraisal.re_execution`. A record earns no assurance from the claim: `runtime.platform` is untouched by it, as it is by `references`, and the record signature covers it.

| Field               | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `function`          | string | **yes**  | Name under which the implementation at `code_identity` exposes the deterministic function re-executed. The convention for invoking it is part of that artifact, and so content-addressed with it                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `code_identity`     | string | **yes**  | `sha256:` or `sha384:` digest of the implementation artifact that contains `function`. Resolves to an artifact a verifier can obtain without the producer. Where the coordination logic ships in the artifact `build_provenance` names, this equals `build_provenance.digest`                                                                                           |
| `code_resolver`     | string | no       | Where the artifact at `code_identity` is obtained: the party obliged to retain it, in the sense `references[].resolver` has. Omitted when the digest alone locates the artifact, as on a package index                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `input_closure`     | array  | **yes**  | The complete content-addressed set of everything `function` reads: the initial configuration and every recorded external interaction, model calls included. Entries are described below. An entry the function does not read is surplus; an input the closure omits makes the claim malformed rather than weak, which is detected at re-execution and not by the schema |
| `transcript_digest` | string | **yes**  | `sha256:` or `sha384:` digest, in the algorithm its prefix names, over the RFC 8785 canonical bytes of the transcript `function` produces over `input_closure`. The transcript is the function's complete output as a JSON value; its shape belongs to the profile or annex that describes the function                                                                 |

### `reproducibility.input_closure` entries

The shape a `references` entry has, without `rel` or `retention`, since every entry stands in the same relation to the claim, and with `digest` required on every entry, since an entry a verifier cannot check against the digest the producer signed pins nothing.

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `digest`   | string | **yes**  | `sha256:` or `sha384:` digest of the input. A verifier holds the input only once what it obtained matches this value                                                                |
| `resolver` | string | **yes**  | Identifier of the party obliged to resolve `id`. A run's closure is run-private by construction, so the producer is an ordinary resolver here: the bar is integrity, not provenance |

Signed vectors that exercise the claim and its result, two per rule the schema enforces, are in [`examples/reproducibility-claim/`](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec/tree/main/examples/reproducibility-claim).

## `build_provenance`

Where the deployed software came from: which build system produced it and the digest (fingerprint) of what it built, following SLSA, a common format for signed build records.

| Field              | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                |

| `builder`          | string  | no       | Builder identity URI (e.g., GitHub Actions SLSA generator)                                 |
| `digest`           | string  | **yes**  | `sha256:` digest of the built artifact                                                     |
| `provenance_uri`   | string  | no       | URI to the SLSA provenance document (e.g., Rekor entry)                                    |
| `provenance_depth` | string  | no       | Depth the issuer claims: `surface`, `builder` or `transitive`. Absent is read as `surface` |

## `appraisal`

A verifier's judgment on the evidence in this record, and who made it.

| Field                       | Type    | Required                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `verifier`                  | string  | **yes**                         | URI of the verifier the record names for this appraisal.

### `appraisal.re_execution` members

The result of re-running a `reproducibility` claim, attributed to the party named as `verifier`. `not-attempted` is not `status: none`: an appraisal was performed, and what it could not do is reported with its cause rather than rounded to either outcome a completed check would have produced. Spec section 3.1.4 says why the two are kept apart.

| `outcome`                | string | **yes**                           | `reproduced`: the re-run completed on the closure alone and its transcript digest equals `transcript_digest`. `diverged`: it completed on the closure alone and the digests differ. `not-attempted`: a closure blob could not be resolved, `code_identity` could not be obtained, the function read beyond the closure, the re-run did not complete, or the verifier could not establish that it used the closure alone |
| `observed_digest`        | string | when `outcome` is `diverged`      | The verifier's digest of the transcript its re-run produced. Divergence localises nothing by itself, so the two transcripts have to be comparable by a third party                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### `appraisal.platform_measurement` members

What a matching `runtime.measurement` covers, layer by layer, attributed to the party named as `verifier`. A composite that matches its reference does not say which layers recorded anything, which were appraised before they ran, or whether the evidence describes one boot; this block says it. `status` is untouched by it, except that a verifier does not report `affirming` while a layer its policy requires is not established or not listed, and a record carrying this block does not report `none`. Spec section 3.1.5.

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `measurement` | string | **yes**  | The digest this appraisal is about. Must equal `runtime.measurement`: a result about another measurement is not about this record                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `layers`      | object | **yes**  | At least one member, keyed by the platform's name for the layer. On `tpm2` the key is `pcr:` and a register number from 0 to 23 in decimal without leading zeros (`pcr:0`, `pcr:23`). Each member carries `outcome` and, when not established, `reason`. A layer not listed is not established, and a record without this block establishes no layer |

Each member of `layers`:

| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `outcome` | string | **yes**                             | `established`, or `not-established`, which is never reported as `established`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `reason`  | string | when `outcome` is `not-established` | `layer-not-measured`: the layer holds no measurement (its initial value, or on a TPM a separator and nothing else). `measured-not-appraised`: the measurements replay to the quoted value and nothing in the evidence shows they were appraised before they ran. `evidence-spans-multiple-boots`: the evidence does not establish that the quote and the event log describe the same single boot, and the log does not replay to the quoted value; not reported as tampering on that basis alone |

## `transparency`

String. URI of the SCITT transparency log entry anchoring this record. Omitted, or `null`, when the record is not anchored at issuance: anchoring may happen asynchronously. Never an empty string: the reference model rejects one (`min_length=1`).

## `cnf`

Confirmation method: the public key bound to this record, which a verifier uses to check the record's signature.

| Field | Type   | Description                                      |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `jwk` | object | JWK-format public key used to verify `signature` |

For a hardware-backed deployment, authenticated platform evidence is expected to bind this public key to the measured environment (see [trust levels](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/trust-levels/index.md)). That binding establishes key association only. It does not by itself establish where the private key was generated, whether it can be exported, or that it never left the TEE: a key generated outside and committed from inside the guest satisfies the same binding. Those properties are claimed only where a platform profile supplies evidence for them, and are reported separately from the binding (#433).

### `cnf.jwk` members

`kty` is required and decides which key-material members are: OKP keys carry `crv` and `x`, EC keys `crv`, `x` and `y`, RSA keys `n` and `e`. A key of one of those types with no material is refused by the schema; a `kty` outside the three passes the schema and is refused by the verifier, which accepts `OKP` only. Members beyond these are permitted, as any value section 3.2.2 can canonicalize, and are inside the signed record like everything else in `cnf`. The private-key parameters `d`, `p`, `q`, `dp`, `dq`, `qi` and `k` are refused: `cnf` is a public proof-of-possession key (RFC 8747).

| `x`   | string | with `OKP` and `EC` | The public key (OKP) or the x coordinate (EC), base64url                                                                                                  |

| `n`   | string | with `RSA`          | Modulus, base64url                                                                                                                                        |
| `e`   | string | with `RSA`          | Public exponent, base64url                                                                                                                                |
| `kid` | string | no                  | Key identifier (RFC 7517 section 4.5). Inside the signed record, so a producer that names its key here names it under the signature rather than beside it |

## Wire formats

TRACE v0.2 supports two wire formats:

**JSON** (primary): signed JSON object with `signature` as a top-level field.

**CBOR-COSE** (constrained devices): COSE_Sign1 structure with TRACE claims as the payload. Defined in §3.2 of the spec: deferred to a future profile for constrained-device deployments.

## Example: AMD SEV-SNP
