# The `references` relation registry

A Trust Record can point at facts kept somewhere else, such as a human approval or a test result. Each pointer carries a label, `rel`, that says what kind of thing it points at. This page lists the agreed labels, what each one points at, and how to propose a new one. It is for people building tools that write or read these pointers.

Informative. The registered values of `references[].rel` (§3.1.2), what each one's referenced object is, what a verifier may conclude from a resolved one, and how a name is added.

## What registration does, and does not do

`rel` is open. The schema constrains it to a non-empty string, the reference model does the same, and §3.1.2 calls its values a registry; an unregistered value validates, signs and verifies. §3.1.1 closes the neighbouring `origin.kind` "because the value of the field is that a verifier can key on it", and §3.1.2 deliberately does not say that of `rel`.

A registered value adds one thing: a shared definition of the referenced object, precise enough that two implementations resolve the same thing and compute the same `digest` over it. What a verifier may conclude from a resolved reference is set by the four rules of §3.1.2, which are normative and the same for every relation, registered or not. Rule 3 is the one this document is bounded by:

> A verifier MUST NOT reject a record because an entry in `references` cannot be resolved, and MUST NOT treat a resolved reference as attested evidence. (§3.1.2, rule 3)

A registration cannot add to those rules; a proposal that needs to is a change to §3.1.2.

What a registered value therefore cannot carry: a requirement on a verifier, an effect on whether the record verifies, or a promotion of the target's content into evidence. A proposal that needs any of those is a change to the normative text of §3.1.2 and follows [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/CONTRIBUTING/#spec-changes-normative-text), sponsor included. The two limits §3.1.2 states for the whole block hold for every entry here as well: a reference cannot carry compliance evidence, and cannot carry a pre-execution commitment.

The registry is enforced without being normative: `tests/test_references_block.py::test_the_registered_rel_values_stay_documented_in_all_three_places` fails if `rel` is closed again, and if a registered value stops being named in the schema description, in `docs/schema.md`, or in this document.

## Registered values

The five labels agreed so far, what each one points at, and where it is defined:

| `rel`                 | Referenced object                                                                               | Defined in                                                                                                                                                                | Example                                                                                                          |

The first three were registered by the change that introduced the block (#197) and their referenced objects are defined to the extent the documents cited define them. Tightening one is a change to make here, on the same terms as adding a name.

## `condition-appraisal`

### Meaning

The record points at what an independent check found when it held a stated subject against a stated condition. The check is anything whose finding a party is willing to sign: a test suite run over a deliverable, a schema validation over a document, a contract check over an interface, a reviewer's verdict over a change. The three values registered before it cover what was asked (`authorized-intent`), who approved (`approval-outcome`) and what the agent did (`behavior-trace`); this is the fourth question a relying party asks, what a check found. §3.3.3 already names that layer for embodied workflows, as "Controller, monitor, human-review, or safety-system observations". A software deliverable has the same layer, and this relation is that layer with the embodiment removed.

Two neighbours it is not. The `appraisal` in the name is the checker's appraisal of the subject; it is not the verifier's appraisal of the record, which the record carries in its own `appraisal` member and which no reference reaches. And a human reviewer's verdict is a `condition-appraisal` only when it states whether the subject meets named criteria and decides nothing about execution; the decision that lets a step-up or defer proceed is `approval-outcome`, whatever the reviewer also found.

### The referenced object

A signed, content-addressed statement. Its wire format belongs to the issuer, not to this specification; what registration fixes is the set of facts it carries and how the reference's `digest` is taken over it, so that two implementations resolve the same object and check the same bytes.

| Fact          | Carried as                                                                                                              | Why it is required                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The condition | An identifier and a digest over the canonical bytes of the criteria the subject was held against                        | A finding with no stated condition is an opinion; two appraisals of one subject under different conditions are incomparable, and the digest is what says so                                  |
| The subject   | An identifier and a digest over the canonical bytes of the deliverable, or of a manifest that names its parts by digest | Binds the finding to exactly the thing checked, so a later version of the deliverable cannot inherit it                                                                                      |
| The issuer    | An identifier for the party that performed the check, and a reference to its verification key                           | §3.3.2's `issuer` and `issuer_key_id`, with the binding to a call replaced by the bindings above                                                                                             |
| The outcome   | A value in the issuer's own closed vocabulary, which the object names, with any detail the issuer chooses               | The finding itself. The vocabulary is the issuer's because the semantics of a check are the issuer's; this specification does not define what `pass` means for a test suite it did not write |
| When          | The time the issuer signed                                                                                              | Separates the finding from the record's `iat`                                                                                                                                                |
| The signature | The issuer's signature over the RFC 8785 canonical form of the object with the signature member absent                  | §3.3.2 step 1, applied to this object                                                                                                                                                        |

The reference's `digest` is over the RFC 8785 canonical form of the complete object, signature included, as the resolver retains it. `id` is the object's identifier within the resolver's system and `resolver` is the party obliged to keep it resolvable, as for every entry.

The committed example, [`examples/condition-appraisal/`](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/examples/condition-appraisal/index.md), shows one concrete shape for these facts; a producer whose checker emits another shape that carries them is within this definition.

### What a verifier may conclude

Three findings, each separable from the others, and a relying party reports all three rather than folding them:

1. **Whether the reference resolves.** If not, the appraisal is unconfirmed. That is a different answer from "no appraisal", and under rule 3 of §3.1.2 it is never a reason to reject the record.
1. **Whether the resolved bytes are the cited bytes.** A digest match establishes identity. A mismatch establishes that what the resolver holds is not what the record cited, which is a finding about the store, not about the record.
1. **Whether the object verifies under its named issuer's key**, when the relying party holds that key. The rule §3.3.2 gives receipts applies unchanged: an issuer key the verifier does not hold makes the object unverified, not invalid.

That is the whole of it, and all three are findings about the object. None reaches the record: it verifies the same whether the reference resolves, matches, or verifies, and nothing in the object becomes attested evidence. The outcome inside the object is reported as the issuer stated it and promotes in neither direction. A `pass` is not attested evidence that the condition held: the record attests that it points at the finding, and the finding is the issuer's. A `fail` is not a finding against the record: the record verifies exactly as it would citing a `pass`, and the example set holds a pass and a fail side by side to keep that so.

What this relation is not. It is not re-execution. A check that is a deterministic function over a pinned closure, a test suite over a deliverable and a suite, a schema validation over a document and a schema, could in principle have its outcome established by the verifier re-running it, under the same `reproduced`, `diverged` and `not-attempted` outcomes §3.1.4 gives for coordination logic. That is an appraisal the verifier performs, never something the reference establishes, and it is a separate proposal from this registration. Nor is it compliance evidence: §3.1.2 says of the whole block that a record pointing at a check attests that it points there, and nothing about whether an obligation was met.

## `observed-effect`

### Meaning

The record points at what an observer the agent does not control saw change while the agent ran: the state before an interval, the state after it, the paths the observation covered, and the authority under which change was permitted. The four values registered before it cover what was asked (`authorized-intent`), who approved (`approval-outcome`), what the agent did (`behavior-trace`) and what a check found (`condition-appraisal`); this is the question a relying party asks after all four, what actually changed.

Two neighbours it is not. A `behavior-trace` is a record of the agent's actions, often written by the agent or its host, and a state change can happen that no action in it accounts for, or fail to happen where one claims it did; an `observed-effect` is taken over the state itself, from outside the party it describes. And it is not a `condition-appraisal`: it states what changed and within what scope, and it holds the change against no criteria. A check over an observed interval, such as whether a write fell outside the permitted paths, is a `condition-appraisal` whose subject is the interval.

### The referenced object

A signed, content-addressed statement. The committed example uses an in-toto Statement in a DSSE envelope whose `predicateType` is `https://probityai.github.io/agent-evidence-vectors/predicate/v1/observed-effect`, and the wire format is the issuer's; what registration fixes is the set of facts the object carries and how the reference's `digest` is taken over it.

| Fact          | Carried as                                                                                    | Why it is required                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The interval  | The state root before, the state root after, and the times the interval opened and was sealed | Without both roots there is no change to point at, only a claim that one happened                                        |
| The scope     | The paths the observation covered, and any part of them it could not see                      | A change observed over part of a system says nothing about the rest; an unstated scope reads as total                    |
| The authority | A digest over the policy or grant under which change was permitted                            | Binds the change to the permission it ran under, so a later grant cannot be read back onto it                            |
| The observer  | An identifier for the party that observed, and a reference to its verification key            | §3.3.2's `issuer` and `issuer_key_id`, with the binding to a call replaced by the bindings above                         |
| The subject   | A digest equal to the after-state root                                                        | Makes the object identify a state, not only describe one                                                                 |
| The signature | The observer's signature over the object                                                      | §3.3.2 step 1, applied to this object; the committed example signs the DSSE pre-authentication encoding of the statement |

The reference's `digest` is over the RFC 8785 canonical form of the complete object, signature included, as the resolver retains it. `id` is the object's identifier within the resolver's system and `resolver` is the party obliged to keep it resolvable, as for every entry.

The committed example, [`examples/observed-effect/`](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/docs/examples/observed-effect/index.md), resolves two statements copied byte for byte from a published conformance corpus for that predicate type, so a second implementation already verifies the objects it cites. A producer whose observer emits another shape that carries these facts is within this definition.

### What a verifier may conclude

The same three findings as for `condition-appraisal`, each separable, all three reported:

1. **Whether the reference resolves.** If not, the observation is unresolved, which is a different answer from "nothing changed", and under rule 3 of §3.1.2 it is never a reason to reject the record.
1. **Whether the resolved bytes are the cited bytes.** A digest match establishes identity; a mismatch is a finding about the store.
1. **Whether the object verifies under its named observer's key**, when the relying party holds that key. An observer key the verifier does not hold makes the object unverified, not invalid.

All three are findings about the object and none reaches the record. What the object reports is carried as the observer stated it and promotes in neither direction: an interval in which the observer and the observed party agree is not attested evidence that the agent's report was true, and one in which they disagree is not a finding against the record. The example set holds an agreeing and a disagreeing interval side by side, and the two records verify identically.

## Adding a name

A registration is a non-breaking spec change of the informative kind under [GOVERNANCE.md](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/GOVERNANCE/#review-periods-by-change-class): an open issue, a minimum of five business days for comment, Maintainer review. It adds no requirement: the list in §3.1.2 grows by a name and every rule there stays as it was, so the sponsor rule of [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://trace.agentrust-io.com/CONTRIBUTING/#spec-changes-normative-text) does not apply. A proposal that does add a requirement is a normative change and follows that rule.

1. **Open an issue.** State the relation's name, the referenced object as the table above does for `condition-appraisal`, in facts rather than in a wire format, and what a verifier may conclude from a resolved one. The answer to the last is rule 3 of §3.1.2 and nothing more; if it is more, the proposal is not a registration. An unregistered `rel` is legal, so a relation one producer emits for its own reader needs no name; register when a second implementation has to resolve the same object.
1. **Open the PR.** It touches the list in §3.1.2 of `spec/trace-v0.2.md`; the `rel` description in `schema/trace-claim.json` and its packaged copy under `src/agentrust_trace/schema/`, with `schema/trace-claim-v0.3-draft.json` regenerated by `scripts/gen_v03_draft_schema.py`; the `rel` row in `docs/schema.md`; and this document, with a section like the one above. `tests/test_references_block.py` checks that the last three name every registered value: add the name to its `registered` tuple and its case table.
1. **Commit an example with recomputable digests.** A set under `examples/<rel>/` whose records verify, whose reference digests recompute from the referenced objects committed beside them, and whose cases include an unresolvable reference and an altered target, so that rule 3 of §3.1.2 is shown rather than asserted. A test under `tests/` recomputes every outcome from the committed bytes, and the set is named in `tests/test_adequacy_all_sets.py` so that nothing on disk goes ungraded.
1. **Record it in `CHANGELOG.md`** under Added, naming the issue and stating that the change is informative.
